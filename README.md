# Soil-moisture-anomaly-detection-
This repository is to showcase my work done as a part time student intern at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies (NCICS). It involves exploring and analysing messy real world soil moisture measurement data in order to use Machin Learning techniques for anomaly detection. The data is obtained from the USCRN soil sensor network. For this phase of the project only data from the Acclima sensors were used.

It involved multiple rounds of data cleaning and preprocessing with discussions with stakeholders, and exploring the use of XGBoost and isolation forests to establish baseline performance and to show Machine Learning techniques can be used to automate the quality control process in detection and flagging anomalous sensor readings.

* The DataPreprocess.ipynb noteook contains all the steps performed over the course of exploring, processing and cleaning the data and applying ML models.
* The param_optimization_approach script contains the code that was run on servers to perform hyperparameter tuning and obtain final results.
